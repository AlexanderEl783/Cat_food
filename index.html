        <h2>About me:</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Alexander. I am 34 years old and I am from Russia.<br>
          I am looking for a Junior Front End Developer position.<br>
          <br>
          <span class="bold-text">My background:</span><br>
          <br>
          For the last 10 years I have worked in the field of construction in the largest Russian companies such as oil and gas company, Russian railway company.
          For the last 4 years I have been leading a team of several people that are preparing permits for construction.
          My work is related to the processing of a large amount of technical, design and legislative documentation.<br>
          <br>
          I can quickly find the information I need in large amounts of data.
          I know how to plan and organize the work of a team. Resolve conflicts in the team, set tasks and supervise their implementation. I have a knack for solving problems in unconventional ways.
          In addition to my main job, I am actively interested in various blockchain and web3 projects.<br>
          <br>
          At the moment, I decided to change my career direction and become a web developer.<br>
          <br>
          I'm looking for a position that can work remotely or with the option to relocate.<br>
          <br>
          <span class="bold-text">My current skills:</span> HTML, CSS, JS, GIT, Github
